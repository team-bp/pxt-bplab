# DHT11 Extension for MakeCode

![DHT11 Image](./icon.png)

This extension allows you to read temperature and humidity data from a DHT11 sensor with the micro:bit.

This extension is an enhanced version of the code originally developed under the MIT License by [tinkertanker/pxt-iot-environment-kit](https://github.com/tinkertanker/pxt-iot-environment-kit.git).

We sincerely appreciate the efforts of the original developers who created the foundation for this extension.

## 🚀 Features

- Easy to read temperature (°C/°F) and humidity values from DHT11 sensor
- Supports both micro:bit V1 and V2 hardware versions
- Built-in timeout protection for stable readings
- Can be registered as a MakeCode extension for easy use
- Support for Korean

## Blocks

### 1. DHT11 Value Block #dht11-dht11value #dht11-dht11value

- 🔹 Description

  - Reads temperature or humidity value from DHT11 sensor
  - Supports both Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature readings
  - Automatically handles different micro:bit hardware versions

- 🔹 Parameters

  - `dht11type`: Type of reading (temperature °C/°F or humidity)
  - `dht11pin`: Digital pin where DHT11 sensor is connected

- 🔹 Returns

  - For temperature (°C): Returns temperature value in Celsius with one decimal place
  - For temperature (°F): Returns Fahrenheit value converted from Celsius reading
  - For humidity: Returns humidity percentage with one decimal place

- 🔹 Internal behavior

  1. Sends start signal to DHT11
  2. Reads 40 bits of data from sensor
  3. Validates checksum
  4. Converts raw data to temperature/humidity values

- ✅ Usage examples

  ```blocks
  let tempC = bplab.dht11.dht11value(DigitalPin.P0, bplab.dht11.DHT11Type.TemperatureC)
  let tempF = bplab.dht11.dht11value(DigitalPin.P0, bplab.dht11.DHT11Type.TemperatureF)
  let humidity = bplab.dht11.dht11value(DigitalPin.P0, bplab.dht11.DHT11Type.Humidity)

  basic.showNumber(tempC)
  basic.showNumber(tempF)
  basic.showNumber(humidity)
  ```
