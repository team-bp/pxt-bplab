# Servo 360 Extension for MakeCode

![Servo Image](./images/servo-360-icon.png)

This extension allows you to control a 360-degree continuous rotation servo motor with the micro:bit.

This extension is an enhanced version of the code originally developed under the MIT License by [tinkertanker/pxt-continuous-servo](https://github.com/tinkertanker/pxt-continuous-servo.git).

We sincerely appreciate the efforts of the original developers who created the foundation for this extension.

## Blocks

### 1. Spin One Way Block #servo360-spinoneway

- 🔹 Description

  - Spins the servo motor in one direction at full speed
  - Default pin is P1

- ✅ Usage example

  ```blocks
  bplab.servo360.spinOneWay(bplab.servo360.ServoPin.P1)
  ```

### 2. Spin Other Way Block #servo360-spinotherway

- 🔹 Description

  - Spins the servo motor in the opposite direction at full speed
  - Default pin is P1

- ✅ Usage example

  ```blocks
  bplab.servo360.spinOtherWay(bplab.servo360.ServoPin.P1)
  ```

### 3. Spin One Way With Speed Block #servo360-spinonewaywithspeed

- 🔹 Description

  - Spins the motor in one direction with variable speed
  - Speed range: 0 to 100
  - Default pin is P1, default speed is 50
