# Ultrasonic Extension for MakeCode

![Ultrasonic Image](./icon.png)

This extension allows you to measure distances using an ultrasonic sensor with the micro:bit.

This extension is an enhanced version of the code originally developed under the MIT License by [microsoft/pxt-sonar](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-sonar.git).

We sincerely appreciate the efforts of the original developers who created the foundation for this extension.

## üöÄ Features

- Easy distance measurement using ultrasonic sensors
- Support for multiple measurement units (microseconds, centimeters, inches)
- Configurable maximum distance measurement
- Simple block interface for easy integration
- Can be registered as a MakeCode extension for easy use
- Support for Korean

## Blocks

### 1. Ping Measurement Block #ultrasonic-ping

- üîπ Description

  - Measures the distance to an object using an ultrasonic sensor
  - Supports different measurement units:
    - Microseconds (Œºs)
    - Centimeters (cm)
    - Inches (inches)

- üîπ Parameters

  - `trig`: Trigger pin for the ultrasonic sensor
  - `echo`: Echo pin for the ultrasonic sensor
  - `unit`: Measurement unit (Œºs, cm, or inches)

- ‚úÖ Usage example

  ```blocks
  let ms = bplab.ultrasonic.ping(DigitalPin.P14, DigitalPin.P15, bplab.ultrasonic.PingUnit.MicroSeconds)
  let cm = bplab.ultrasonic.ping(DigitalPin.P14, DigitalPin.P15, bplab.ultrasonic.PingUnit.Centimeters)
  let inches = bplab.ultrasonic.ping(DigitalPin.P14, DigitalPin.P15, bplab.ultrasonic.PingUnit.Inches)

  basic.showNumber(ms)
  basic.showNumber(cm)
  basic.showNumber(inches)
  ```

## üîß How it works

The ultrasonic sensor sends out a pulse and measures the time it takes for the echo to return:

1. Trigger pin sends a 10Œºs pulse
2. Echo pin measures the return time
3. Distance is calculated based on the selected unit:
   - Centimeters = echo time / 58
   - Inches = echo time / 148
   - Microseconds = raw echo time
